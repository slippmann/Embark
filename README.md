# Embark
A widows program that allows opening programs using only an XBOX controller.

## Installation Info
If you are only interested in using the software all you need to do is run the "EmbarkSetup.msi" file.

If the option to *'Start Embark when "Menu" and "View" buttons are held down'* is selected during setup, two features are added to your system that become available as soon as the controller is connected.
   1. Holding the "Menu" button and the "View" button for 3 seconds will open Embark.
   2. Holding the "Menu" button and "LS" (Left Stick) button for 3 seconds will enable the user to point and click using the left stick and the A button respectively.

For both of the above features, the cursor will "wiggle" when the command is accepted.

**IMPORTANT: Neither of the above features will be available if the *'Start Embark when "Menu" and "View" buttons are held down'* checkbox is unchecked.**

## Support
Currently this program only supports XBOX controllers and has only been tested with an XBOX One controller. USB, Bluetooth and controller dongle should all work with Embark.
